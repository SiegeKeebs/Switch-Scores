# Switch-Scores
Summary of switch reviews

All my reviews are conducted on a QK65 with FR4 Plate (which will be replaced in September with a QK65 R2 w/ Aluminum plate)

Plate foam only

DISCLAIMER
I do everything I can to try to make these tests useful, I provide objective data (audio) so that you can make up your own opinions on the sound, then I try to provide useful succinct subjective evaluations of the switch performance. Switches FEEL and SOUND different in different keyboards, with different plates and foams. This is meant to be useful, and subjectively objective. I have my own biases and preferences which will influence my opinions despite trying to be neutral. 

I cannot control the device you are listening to this video on, I try to make sure that when I play back my videos that it sounds like it does when I am typing, but I do not know what device you are using to listen. There is always a bit of nuance that is missing, and this should be useful to determine how different switches are from each other and to get a general idea of the characteristics of a switch sound, but do not expect to replicate the sounds exactly from my videos even if you copy my exact configuration. A lot of these switches will sound and feel very similar, and truthfully, they are. The differences between a lot of these switches is really nuanced and small, which is why I give subjective evaluations to pick out the small differences and try to point out little details which are different or difficult to notice just from the audio clip.


The purpose of these reviews is to provide subjective evaluations of switches with a Standardized setup to evaluate switches as objectively as possible and so that sound tests can be compared against each other to determine the differences between switches as objectively as one can using online sound tests.

Standardizations for tests: (All of these things are identical for every test)

Keyboard (QK65) 

Plate (FR4)

Foam (ONLY plate foam!)

Desk Mat (Dots)

EVALUATIONS: 1-10 scale but realistically the useful range is 5-10 - if something scores a 6 or below it’s notably worse than the average switch. A ‘good’ switch should be a 7 or 8 in every category. A great switch will be 8-9. 

Sound - My keyboard is set up in a clacky way, but a QK65 is also a fairly deep sounding keyboard. This does have an impact on switch sounds, and switches will sound notably different in different keyboards

Smoothness - This is only evaluating the smoothness of a switch. This is only evaluated on the keyboard with a keycap - I don’t care if a switch is smooth if you hold it up by itself and press it - that isn’t how a switch is used so it’s irrelevant. Many switches feel smooth in the hand, but do not in a keyboard. Lube here has a significant effect - consider an average switch to be about an 8 when lubed. A stock switch scoring an 8 is very good - generally there is no scratch sound when a switch is an 8 smoothness. At 7 there is going to be a little bit of scratch and probably a scratchy sound. 6 and below is a scratchy switch, there is definitely going to be both felt and heard scratch.

Feel - I think it’s important to separate smoothness and feeling. A smooth switch doesn’t necessarily feel good, and a scratchy switch doesn’t mean it feels bad. This evaluates a number of things, smoothness, spring weight, inconsistencies, binding, stick/slip, bottom out, travel distance, etc.

Overall - This generally should reflect the average of the above scores - but it also gives a place to evaluate a switch as an entire package - some switches even if they score well individually, might just not be enjoyable to use overall, and some switches even if they score poorly, are still really pleasant to use. This is the most subjective of the ‘objective’ ratings.

Personal Rating - I genuinely try to be objective for the switch evaluations, this is where I rate how much I like a switch and whether I personally want to use it on any of my keyboards.












MY BIASES: I do my best to not be influenced by these in my ratings, but they will always have at least some influence over my evaluations of a switch - I figure it’s best to be upfront and clear about my preferences and biases.

Sound - 
I generally prefer switches with a distinct sound, either clacky, or thocky, louder, etc. A ‘generic’ and inoffensive sound won’t be rated highly.
I do not generally like the sound of uhmwpe infused switches, it’s too high pitched
I am not particularly sensitive to spring ping or leaf ping, but I will note it when it’s noticeably to me

Smoothness - 
Generally, I think this is the least biased
I mostly evaluate a switch’s smoothness based on how it feels being used, not just sitting and pressing it slowly. I do factor in slowly pressing a switch though but only 20-30% of the evaluation is based on that.


Feeling - 
I like a light spring weight <62g
I prefer long pole (3.0-3.7mm)
I prefer the feeling of a slightly scratchy unlubed switch over a ‘slow’ thick/heavy lubed switch (e.g. Aqua Kings feel disgusting to me)
I prefer a consistent lube feeling.
I prefer a firm bottom out (which is why I like long pole)
I prefer a ‘tight’ ‘solid’ feeling switch - generally this means a switch that has good tolerances and no/little stem wobble


The ‘best’ switch in my opinion is one:
Sound - that has a clear, distinct sound that isn’t too high pitched or sharp.
Smooth - It is exceedingly smooth while being completely unlubed
Feeling - It has that ‘glidey’ feeling that polished or super smooth switches have that is ruined by lube. It has a 60g spring. It has a long pole (3.4mm travel?). It has very little stem wobble, and a solid bottom out.
